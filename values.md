## Values

### Our pledge is to design and make an offer of clothing that ask the minimum of our natural global resources and to actively seek out systems and processes that allow us to bring existing and dormant materials to life... partnering with innovative makers to create new and efficient materials from regenerated element, sourcing certified organic cottons that support their growers with fair pay and ethical working conditions... We pledge to open our opportunities to every person that shares our mission; no matter their gender, race, or religion. We understand that creativity comes from a wide range of perspectives that should be shared and brought to life through a singular platform of intention.
